# Pseudocde
# Write a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

# Traverse the linked list to find its length.

# Initialize two pointers: slow and fast.

# Move fast twice as quickly as slow to find the middle.

# Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from slow.

# Compare the first half with the reversed second half.

# If they match, the linked list is a palindrome.

# Restore the reversed second half to maintain the original structure.
