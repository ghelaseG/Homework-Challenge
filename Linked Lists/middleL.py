# Pseudocode
# Delete middle of linked list.

# Employ two pointers: slow and fast.

# Traverse the list with both pointers:
#1) Start both at the head.
#2) Move fast twice as quickly as slow.
#3) When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.

# Delete the middle node:
# Reassign the next pointer of the node before slow to skip slow.

# Handle edge cases:
# Account for an empty list or a list with fewer than three nodes.
