# Write a program to reverse the array without built-in array methods

# Pseudocode:

## Initialize variables start and end to represent the start and end indices of the array.
## Use a while loop to iterate until start is less than end.
## Inside the loop, swap the elements at indices start and end.
## Move start index towards the end of the array and end index towards the start of the array.
## Continue the loop until start is no longer less than end.
## Return the reversed array.
