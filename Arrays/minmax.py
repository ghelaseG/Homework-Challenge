# Pseudocode 


# Find the minimum and maximum element in an array without built-in array methods:

# Start by checking if the array is empty. If it is, return a message indicating that the array is empty.

# Initialize variables min_element and max_element with the first element of the array.

# Iterate through the array.

# For each element, compare it with the current min_element and max_element.

# Update min_element if the current element is smaller.

# Update max_element if the current element is larger.

# After iterating through the array, return a tuple containing the minimum and maximum elements.
